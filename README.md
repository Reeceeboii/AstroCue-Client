## _Planning and logging astronomical observations via computational astronomy, open data, and public APIs._

## ðŸŽ“ This repo forms a part of my university dissertation that received a final mark of 91%.

### Please note that this repository comprises the client of the full distributed client-server architecture that was implemented to make AstroCue function. As with most similar setups, the client is mostly passive, acting as a intermediary between the user and the server (backend).

### This is a React and Next.js web app, written in TypeScript. It is hosted on Vercel. It uses [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for state management, and [MUI](https://mui.com/) for UI components. [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) is used for HTTP requests.

### The large majority of the logic and interesting implementation details are held and documented in the separate [AstroCue-Server](https://github.com/Reeceeboii/AstroCue-Server) repository. There you will  also find links to the main dissertation document, as well as a demo video that can be used to see how AstroCue functioned along with its main features and UI elements.

### Please note that since receiving grades for this project, AstroCue is no longer active. The webpage ([astrocue.co.uk](https://astrocue.co.uk)) can still be seen, but new registrations and logins are no longer accepted.
